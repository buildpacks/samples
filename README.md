# Buildpack Samples 
[![Build Status](https://github.com/buildpacks/samples/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/buildpacks/samples/actions) [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/buildpacks/samples)

This repository contains sample implementations of the core components of the [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) (CNB) project for learning and testing purposes.

Includes:

- [Apps](apps/)
- [Buildpacks](buildpacks/)
- [Builders](builders/)
- [Base Images](base-images/)
- [Packages](packages/)


### Start here:

To get up and running, [install `pack`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/install-pack/) and run `make build-linux` or `make build-windows`, depending on your choice of target OS.
Follow the `README.md` docs at the root directory of each component to choose your next step. We recommend starting to play with building [apps](./apps).


### External Buildpacks

* [CloudFoundry Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudfoundry/cnb)
* [Heroku Java Cloud Native Buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/java-buildpack)
