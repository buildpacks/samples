# Sample Builders

A sample of builders that use the [stacks](../stacks/) in this repo.

### Contains:
- [Alpine](alpine/)
- [Jammy](jammy/)

### Additional Resources

* [`pack builder create` documentation](https://buildpacks.io/docs/using-pack/working-with-builders/)

### What's next?

Is that all? If you want to dive deeper take a look at:
- [Build and Run Images](../images) marry the build-time and run-time environments for your code in the form of images under a common id.
- [Buildpackages](../packages) allow easy distribution of buildpacks in image registries and simplify configuration and composition of builders and "meta" buildpacks.
