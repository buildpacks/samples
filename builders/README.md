### What's next?

Is that all? If you want to dive deeper, there are two final components you might want to learn about:
- [Base Images](../base-images) provide the build-time and run-time environments for your code.
- [Buildpackages](../packages) allow easy distribution of buildpacks in image registries and simplify configuration and composition of builders and "meta" buildpacks.
